   A simple sketch Arduino using Marcelino cores.

   Using pwm mode in pin OC0B (Digital pin 5)
   The pwm frequency will be adjusted by the comparator A.

   For detail of this modules read the manual.

  //Only remember, the minimum frequency is 3.9KHz and maximum is 1MHz

    int a = 1000*i;           //The frequency will be a multiple of 1000

  //Note, in this application the resolution of the PWM decreases as the value of comparator A decreases
