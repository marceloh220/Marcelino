   A simple sketch Arduino using Marcelino cores.

   Using pwm mode in pin OC1B (Digital pin 10)
   The pwm frequency will be adjusted by the comparator A.

   Using pwm mode in pin OC1B (Digital pin 10) AND pin OC1A (Digital pin 9)
   The pwm frequency will be adjusted by the capture register.

   For detail of this modules read the manual.
