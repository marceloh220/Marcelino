The ATmega48A/PA/88A/PA/168A/PA/328/P contains 256/512/512/1Kbytes of data EEPROM memory. It is
organized as a separate data space, in which single bytes can be read and written. The EEPROM has an
endurance of at least 100,000 write/erase cycles. The access between the EEPROM and the CPU is described
in the following, specifying the EEPROM Address Registers, the EEPROM Data Register, and the EEPROM
Control Register.

This module is compatible with:
									Atmega48A/Atmega48PA with 256Bytes of EEPROM,
									Atmega88A/Atmega88PA with 512Bytes of EEPROM,
									Atmega168A/Atmega168PA with 512Bytes of EEPROM,
									Atmega328/Atmega328P (Arduino Uno) with 1kBytes of EEPROM,

The EEPROM library is writed by David A. Mellis and provide methods to access the EEPROM memory of the microcontroller.
