	Hi, i'm a brazilian engineer student.
	This text are completely in english, a bad english, sorry about that,
	but still is english.
	
	Why that? Most of the material for technology students is in English, 
	and that language becomes a global language.
	Therefore, this material can reach a larger audience being written so,
	again sorry for bad English.
	
	The sketches following in this example are a way to show the features of this core.

	The Marcelino core are distributed with a GPL 3.0 use license.
	
	The Marcelino project is open to contributors of anything, with code programming,
	documentation or any guidance on setting up the microcontrollers.
	
	Be free to study this core, modify and distribute the modifications,

	The extensible core Marcelino to Arduino Uno/Nano/Mini boards*.

	Core Marcelino expands software configuration capabilities, giving the programmer easy 
	tools to configure these Arduino boards.
	Program the Arduino without software limitations,
	and explorer the powerful hardware of ATmega328 microcontroller.
	
	*Any module is compatible with:
					Atmega48A/Atmega48PA,
					Atmega88A/Atmega88PA,
