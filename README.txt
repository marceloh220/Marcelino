	The marcelino core is in 2.0 version!

	Now the Marcelino core has a new method to access digital pins and external interrupts from PCMASK, this method is based on the GPIO control of the CMSIS ARM microcontroller.
	This method reduces memory usage and module overhead, increasing speed and flexibility.
	The Delay module has changed to it make more independent from avr-libc.
